 import React from 'react'
//var React = require('react');
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
//var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');


// ReactDOM.render("Kya dikhana hai (What to show)", "Kha dikhana hai (Where to show)" ,'Callback function');
ReactDOM.render(<h1>Hello World!</h1>, document.getElementById('root'));


//React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces, 
// and Babel helps developers write React code using modern JavaScript features that may not be supported by all browsers
// So Babel convert this modern javascript code into that format that understand by browser.

// Note** : JSX is a syntactic extension of JavaScript that allows you to write HTML-like code within your JavaScript code. When you use JSX in your React components, it gets transformed into regular JavaScript code before being executed.
